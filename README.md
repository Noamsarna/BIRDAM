## Data 
Fully-anonymized experimental data is available [here](https://osf.io/6npd9/files/osfstorage)

## Demos 
You can try the online experiment by clicking [here](https://noamsarna.github.io/BIRDAM/experiment/countDots/)

## Analysis Scripts
A fully reproducible version analysis pipeline in RMD format is available [here](https://github.com/Noamsarna/BIRDAM/blob/main/docs/prePrint.Rmd). To run the RMD file, the data must first be imported from OSF storage and placed in the data folder.

## Pre-registration time-locking üïùüîí 
To ensure preregistration time-locking (in other words, that preregistration preceded data collection), we employed [randomization-based preregistration](https://medium.com/@mazormatan/cryptographic-preregistration-from-newton-to-fmri-df0968377bb2). We used the SHA256 cryptographic hash function to translate our preregistered protocol folder (including the pre-registration document) to a string of 256 bits. These bits were then combined with the unique identifiers of single subjects, and the resulting string was used as seed for initializing the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator prior to determining all random aspects of the experiment. This way, experimental randomization was causally dependent on, and therefore could not have been determined prior to, the specific contents of our preregistration document [(Mazor, Mazor & Mukamel, 2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejn.14278).

## Experiment

The experiment was run in two batches due to a minor bug in the experiment code. Therefore, we provide preregistration time-locking summaries for both runs.
